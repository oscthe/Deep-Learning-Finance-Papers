# Deep-Learning-Finance-Papers

This repository is inspired by the [Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap](https://github.com/floodsung/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap) but rather specifically focused on papers relating deep learning to applications in finance. As such, this repository is divided into sections representing areas within finance I have explored the literature within. 

This list is an ongoing one so I will continue adding papers.
